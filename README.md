CKGAT
=====
Hi! You are welcome to visit here!<br>
This repository will be used to release the code of CKGAT, a newly proposed method for knowledge graph-based top-N recommendation by our research team. CKGAT stands for the Collaborative Knowledge-aware Graph Attention Network for top-N Recommendation, which can learn refined ripple set embeddings, thereby generating accurate user embeddings and item embeddings, so as to accurately capture users’ potential interests in items. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method that uses the knowledge-aware graph attention network to learn the refined ripple set embeddings. The research paper of CKGAT has been submitted to an international journal. 

In essence, our CKGAT method makes two important improvements to the Collaborative Knowledge-aware Attentive Network (CKAN) [by Z. Wang et al., SIGIR'20, https://doi.org/10.1145/3397271.3401141], a typical state-of-the-art propagation-based recommendation method: the generation of ripple set embeddings, and the generation of user/item embeddings. When implementing our CKGAT method, we used the PyTorch framework to modify the CKAN code in two major aspects: (1) Modify the knowledge-aware attentive embedding layer in CKAN to the knowledge-aware GAT-based attentive embedding layer in CKGAT; (2) Modify the aggregator in CKAN to the attention aggregator in CKGAT. ***PLEASE NOTE THAT*** *the code of CKGAT will not be released immediately (postponed until the paper is accepted by and published in the journal).*


Four real-world datasets (Last.FM, Book-Crossing, MovieLens 20M, and Dianping-Food) were used to empirically evaluate the performance of CKGAT, and the experimental results show that CKGAT overall outperforms three baseline methods (BPRMF, CKE, and KPRN) and six state-of-the-art propagation-based recommendation methods (RippleNet, CKAN, KGCN, KGNN-LS, KGAT, and KGIN) in terms of recommendation accuracy, and outperforms four representative propagation-based recommendation methods (KGNN-LS, KGAT, CKAN, and KGIN) in terms of recommendation diversity. Detailed information about the experimental datasets and the comparison methods are given below.


Experimental Datasets
------
* **Last.FM** (https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/)**.** This dataset [1] contains social networking, tagging, and music artist listening information from a set of 2,000 users from Last.fm online music system. Instead of the original dataset, our experiments directly used the preprocessed Last.FM dataset and its corresponding knowledge graph released on GitHub [available at https://github.com/weberrr/CKAN/tree/master/data] by Z. Wang et al. [2]

* **Book-Crossing** (http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/)**.** This dataset [3] collects explicit ratings (ranging from 0 to 10) from different readers about various books in the book-crossing community. Instead of the original dataset, our experiments directly used the preprocessed Book-Crossing dataset and its corresponding knowledge graph released on GitHub [available at https://github.com/weberrr/CKAN/tree/master/data] by Z. Wang et al. [2]

* **MovieLens 20M** (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/)**.** This dataset [4] is a widely used benchmark dataset in movie recommendation, which contains approximately 20 million explicit user ratings for movies (ranging from 1 to 5) on the MovieLens website. Instead of the original dataset, our experiments directly used the preprocessed MovieLens 20M dataset and its corresponding knowledge graph released on GitHub [available at https://github.com/weberrr/CKAN/tree/master/data] by Z. Wang et al. [2]

* **Dianping-Food** (https://www.dianping.com/)**.** This dataset is provided by Meituan-Dianping Group (Dianping.com), which contains 10 million interaction data (including clicks and purchases, etc.) between approximately 2 million users and 1,000 restaurants. Instead of the original dataset, our experiments directly used the preprocessed Dianping-Food dataset and its corresponding knowledge graph released on GitHub [available at https://github.com/hwwang55/KGNN-LS/tree/master/data/restaurant] by H. Wang et al. [5]
