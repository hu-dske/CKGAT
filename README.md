CKGAT
=====
Hi! You are welcome to visit here!<br>
This library will be used to release the source code of CKGAT, a newly proposed model for knowledge graph-based top-N recommendation. The research paper of CKGAT has been submitted to an International journal. CKGAT’s code will ***not*** be released immediately (postponed until the paper is accepted and published). <br>
<br>
CKGAT stands for Collaborative Knowledge-aware Graph Attention Network for top-N Recommendation. Four real-world datasets (Last.FM, Book-Crossing, MovieLens 20M, and 79 Dianping-Food) were used to empirically evaluate the performance of CKGAT, and the experimental results show that CKGAToverall outperforms three baseline methods and six state-of-the-art propagation-based recommendation methods in terms of recommendation accuracy, and outperforms four representative propagation-based recommendation methods in terms of recommendation diversity. The information about the three baseline methods and the six state-of-the-art methods are given below.
